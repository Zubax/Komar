Phase connector blow scheme is shown in the picture below.

It consists of:

* Connector body. An ABS plastic 3D printed part.
* Three 4.5 mm female bullet connectors (the same that are used in XT90 power connectors)
* Three pieces of 3 mm<sup>2</sup> copper wire (approx 25 mm length).



I order to assemble the phase connector following steps should be done:

1) 3D print  the connector housing. Any generic FDM 3d printer will do the job. No special settings needed. Support structures are optional. It may be needed to clear the holes for bullet connectors with 4.5 mm drill bit after the printing. 

2) Solder three pieces of wire to the bullet connectors.

3) Glue bullet connectors in housing using any two component epoxy glue. Bullet connectors should be placed as in the picture below:

4) Form and trim wires in place. 

5) Place a piece of heatshrinking tube on all the wires so that it covers all the surface of the wire excluding approx 2-3 mm on the side that is meant for soldering to the PCB. 

The final result should like this:
