# Komar
Its like [Zubax Myxa](https://zubax.com/products/myxa) but on steroids and in the form-factor of integrated drive. 

Komar uses [Mitochondrik](https://zubax.com/products/mitochondrik) motor controller chip to run [Zubax TÃ©lega](https://zubax.com/technologies/telega) motor control solution

Komar is a reference design for Zubax Mitochondrik that utilizes most of its capabilities and interfaces.
